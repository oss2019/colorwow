# What has to be done :
To enhance the present pygame and to build pygame bits if superb ideas persists

# Motivation:

1.As python is the new big word and game development has been fascinating from a long while !
here you can learn both of them .

2.Implementation and learning of image processing will be an important part .

3.And "interfacing" which seems a small task will help you learn deeper bugging concepts and make you realise that its not that small .

4.An interesting example for learning OOPS.

# Features :

You will learn building a pygame, basic concepts of OOPS .
You will learn image processing .
You will be interfacing it which will make you learn many things .
(You may use an arduino, ros if you are a vry beginner which will still make you learn many things . )
You will learn manimations( animations using just python codes ) all along .

# Planned Schedule :

# Phase 1:
Learning pygame and building small pygame bits.

# Phase 2 :
Improvement in the present pygame project. (and if a fascinating idea persists, working on both of them )
Adding features .

# Phase 3 :
making use of adaptive thresholding in image processing.
implementing image processing for 'Eye-Detection'.
Interfacing for player movement using movement of 'Eye' .
(for errors we will be using ROS..(robotics operating system)...  )

# Phase 4 :
learning manimations
and slot of implementing it .

## P.S: though its a lot many things but things would be easier, interesting and learing at the same time .
