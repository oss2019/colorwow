#  Making small pygame bits for 
1. Random platforms with rising screen (and faling if able) .
2. Sprite auto-rotation and rotative firing .
3. Timer generation and score and highscore saving and updating .
4. Sprite manual rotation using keyboard interrupts .
5. Making a simple ‘snake’ game .
6. Putting animations,graphics on the start-screen, background, game-over screen, putting animated borders as well ( simple for now.... manimations* after a couple of more phases )
